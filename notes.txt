Architechture:

Modules:
 The modules are nothing but few lines of code that can be imported and exported 
 Root module(App module) is the basic which every angular project has.

Components:
 Each module is intern made up of components and services
 A component controlls certain portion of the view on the browser
 eg: component for nav, sidebar etc 
 Every angular project has a main component called as root component(AppComponents)
 All the other components will be nested inside this AppComponent.

Architechture summary:
 Angular App: has one or more modules.
 Module: has one or more components and services(can be exported and imported whereever required inside the projects)
 Components: has HTML + class
 Services: business Logic of the application

NOTE:
 In the src folder we have main.ts which is the entry point to our Angular application 
 We also have the app folder which contains the file app.module.ts which is the root module of our application and also app.component.ts root component
